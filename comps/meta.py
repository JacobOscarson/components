==========
Components
==========

Educational tool for kids to finds components of a number. This is a
"Scratch" / prototype implementation that will test the idea. The
gist:

    1. A random number is generated

    2. The player gets to write an expression that should evaluate to
     the number. If the expression is correct, a score is calculated
     from the following:
       1. Every addition in the expression gives 1 point
       2. Every subtraction gives 2 points
       3. Every multiplication gives 4 points
       4. Every division gives 8 points
    3. After N numbers have been given, all points are summarised, and
    preferably time taken to complete is factored into the overall
    score (method for this to be worked out).
