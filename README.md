# Components - visualise a number as parts

Educational tool for kids to finds components of a number. This is a
"Scratch" / prototype implementation that will test the idea. The
gist:

    1. A random number is generated
    2. The player gets to write an expression that should evaluate to
     the number. If the expression is correct, a score is calculated
     from the following:
       1. Every addition in the expression gives 1 point
       2. Every subtraction gives 2 points
       3. Every multiplication gives 4 points
       4. Every division gives 8 points
    3. After N numbers have been given, all points are summarised, and
     preferably time taken to complete is factored in to the overall
     score (method for this to be worked out).

The initial Python implementation will be used to test the idea on my
own children. If the games seems beneficial I might port it to other
platforms where it's easier to implement more interactivity and nicer
media.
